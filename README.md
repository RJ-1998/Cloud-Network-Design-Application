# Cloud-Network-Design-Application

It was my 3rd year Computer Science Project and I completed it partially.

Basically it is a web application which helps to upload,delete and list files from the cloud storage.
It was designed with these technologies.

### React.js to built the frontend

### Node.js to built the backend

### Google Cloud Storage Platform
